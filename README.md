# Skeleton Framework for Jekyll

An implementation of Dave Gamache's Skeleton framework in Jekyll. The original Skeleton framework and docs are available from http://getskeleton.com/.

## Getting Started

As few changes to the base Skeleton framework have been made. If you have a feature request, please make a formal request on the original Skeleton framework.

Start using Skeleton with Jekyll:
- [Download a zip archive of the repository] (https://github.com/bradfordlynch/Skeleton-framework-jekyll/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/bradfordlynch/Skeleton-framework-jekyll.git'

### Scaffolding

Included is Skeleton's base CSS, image files (A favicon), and index.html. The head content has been moved into an include and the default layout contains everything except for the content div's of Skeleton's index.html.
